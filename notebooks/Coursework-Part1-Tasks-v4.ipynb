We will go through the whole process from loading preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. I will also introduce here a few additional elements, such as the NLTK and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, to which I have put links in this document.  \n\nThe structure is similar to the lab sheets. I provide a code structure with gaps that you are supposed to file. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \nplease leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n\nI have added numerous comments in text cells and the code cells to guid you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n\nOnce you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outpus, but downlaod the notebook (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle.
